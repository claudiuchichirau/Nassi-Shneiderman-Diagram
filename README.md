# Nassi-Shneiderman-Diagram
This project is a C++ implementation of an application that takes as input a pseudocode and displays the [Nassi-Shneiderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) plot corresponding to the given pseudocode.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Run `main.cpp`

## Project Description
This project is a C++ implementation of an application that takes as input a pseudocode and displays the [Nassi-Shneiderman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassi%E2%80%93Shneiderman_diagram) plot corresponding to the given pseudocode.

The Nassi-Shneiderman diagram is a graphical representation of pseudocode that uses simple geometric shapes to represent data flow control structures.

The project also uses the graphics.h library to create and display the Nassi-Shneiderman plot. The chart is displayed in a graphics window and can be zoomed in or out using the arrow keys. The user can also use the mouse to move the chart inside the graphics window.

Overall, the project is a complex and well-structured implementation of a pseudocode transformation algorithm into a Nassi-Shneiderman diagram.
